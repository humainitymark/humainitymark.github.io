## Statement

We prioritize financial frugality in all organizational operations. Inexpensive systems and solutions are favored because they are easier to maintain, offer greater transparency, and are more likely to be sustainable over time. By choosing low-cost approaches—where we have clear visibility into the inputs we are building—we improve the long-term viability and resilience of our work.

## Rationale

Financial frugality directly supports the value of sustainability. Systems that minimize ongoing costs are less likely to be abandoned and more likely to serve their purpose over the long term. Transparent, low-cost solutions increase our ability to understand, maintain, and adapt our infrastructure as needs evolve.

## Application

- Prioritize solutions with minimal ongoing financial burden.
- Choose open, transparent systems that allow for deep visibility into their inputs and operations.
- Evaluate alternatives not only on up-front cost, but also on long-term sustainability and maintainability.
- Avoid vendor lock-in and opaque pricing models when possible.
